\mt2 The letter written to the Hebrew people
\is Important matter about this letter
\ip Jesus disciples proclaimed the good news about the saving-one Christ to all people all over the world. Through this many of the Jewish people became Christians. Other people caused many troubles and difficulties to come on them. Then those Christians were thinking about leaving their faith and returning to their old customs. It was for these Hebrew people who were thinking like this that one of Jesus's servants wrote this letter.
\ip In this letter it is written about Jesus Christ who fulfilled God's desire which the old covenant was not able to fulfil. In this letter are three important points:
\imi \k (1)\k* Jesus Christ is God's son. He prepared himself to bear the suffering in order to fulfil God's will. That Jesus Christ is the first from among all the angels, prophets and men that God sent.
\imi \k (2)\k* God showed that Jesus is the forever living High Priest greater than all the High Priests living before Jesus Christ.
\imi \k (3)\k* The Hebrew people used to think that giving animal sacrifices and walking according to customs-and-rituals would save them from their sins. But in this letter [it says] that only Jesus Christ alone can save from sin, fear and death.

\s Jesus Christ is God's son
\p
\v 1 In ancient times, many times and in many ways, God spoke to our ancestors through the prophets.
\v 2 But in these last days he spoke with us through his son. Through his son he created this creation. He chose that son to be like an inheritor of this creation.
\v 3-4 That son is the exact appearance of God's character and he shines with his (God's) amazing light. That son by his own powerful word is ruling all of this creation. He cleansed us from all sins. Because of this, having gone to the all-powerful God who is in heaven he sat down at his right hand side.\f * \fr 1:3-4 \fq right hand side \ft means the place of honour and authority.\f* Having seen this we know that son's name and honour is much higher than God's angels.
\q1
\v 5 “You are my son.
\q2 Today I have fathered you”\x + \xo 1:5 \xt Psalms 2:7\x*
\m like-that God never told any angel as he said to (the) son. Like that and in another place God said,
\q1 “I will become his father.
\q2 He will become my son”\x + \xo 1:5 \xt 2 Samuel 7:14; 1 Chronicles 17:13\x*
\m like-that except for Jesus [he] never said to any angel.
\p
\v 6 Not only this, [but] in another place, when he called his first-born son into this world then
\q1 “All of his [God's] angels should worship \f * \fr 1:6 \ft Prayer and praising having knelt down with devotion.\f*him”
\m he told like that.
\q1
\v 7 “God makes his angels like wind
\q1 and his servants like flames of fire” \x + \xo 1:7 \xt Psalms 104:4\x*
\m God told like that about his angels.
\p
\v 8 But about his son,
\q1 “Oh God, your throne will stand forever.
\q2 You will rule with justice.
\q1
\v 9 You love justice
\q2 and hate injustice.
\q1 Because of this the Lord your God,
\q2 having chosen you, from among everyone
\q1 and given you honour, filled you with joy”\x + \xo 1:9 \xt Psalms 45:6,7\x*
\m he told like that.
\p
\v 10 And [he] also said about his son,
\q1 “Lord, in the beginning you are the creator of the earth.
\q1 You even created the sky.
\q1
\v 11 They will be totally destroyed,
\q2 but you are the one who will stay forever.
\q1 They will become old like worn out clothes.
\q1
\v 12 Like old clothes you will fold
\q2 and throw the earth and the sky.
\q1 Instead of them you will exchange for [something] new.
\q1 But you are always staying the same.
\q2 You will never become a dying one”\x + \xo 1:12 \xt Psalms 102:25-27\x*
\m he told like that.
\p
\v 13 And also,
\q1 “Until I have put your enemies like a foot-stool beneath your feet,
\q2 come and sit at my right-hand side”\x + \xo 1:13 \xt Psalms 110:1\x*
\m like-that God did not tell to any angel as he said to Jesus.
\p
\v 14 Those angels are spiritual beings and servants of God. They are the ones sent to help those who will be saved.
\c 2
\s Telling (us) to stay alert
\p
\v 1 Therefore having carefully listened to the true message, see that you don't slide away from God's truth.
\v 2 Because, the news that was told by the angels was in force and whoever does not follow that news,\f * \fr 2:2 \ft This is Moses' law.\f* his each and every unrighteous (deed) and bad works got what it deserved.
\v 3 If we do not live by following such a great news of salvation then how can we escape from the coming punishment? The Lord first told us the news of this eternal life (salvation). Those who heard that news told us that truth (which was with them).
\v 4 At that time God demonstrated that the news is true by doing many wonders and miraculous works and by giving his devotees powerful gifts of his \w Holy Spirit\w* as he wished.
\s Jesus taking the form of a human
\p
\v 5 We are speaking about the future age. God has not handed it over into angels' hands.
\v 6 Instead of this someone has told witness like this in the holy scriptures:
\q1 “Oh God! In order for you to think and remember
\q2 about mankind how worthless he is?
\q1
\v 7 For a little while, you gave mankind
\q2 a lower status than even the angels,
\q1 but in order to give (much) honour,
\q2 you put a crown of glory on his head.
\q1
\v 8 and you put everything under his feet”\x + \xo 2:8 \xt Psalms 8:4-6\x*
\m it is written like that. ‘All things’ meaning, God has given him authority over everything, without exception. But now everything is not appearing to be under his authority.
\v 9 But the truth is that for a little while Jesus was even lower status than the angels. By God's grace Jesus having borne the suffering (he) died for all the people of the world. Therefore God crowned him with glory and honour.
\v 10 God created all these things and is sustaining all things for himself. Because of this, in order to take many people to the place of glory, God decided that it is right that the saviour Jesus having suffered becomes a perfect one.
\s Jesus is not ashamed to call mankind his brothers
\p
\v 11 The Jesus holy maker of sinners and the ones he made holy are all people who took birth from one father. Therefore Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers.
\q1
\v 12 “I will tell about your name
\q2 to my brothers.
\q1 Praising you in front of all the gathered people,
\q2 I will sing praise-songs”\x + \xo 2:12 \xt Psalms 22:22\x*
\m he said like that to God.
\p
\v 13 In another place
\q1 “My trust is in God.”\x + \xo 2:13 \xt Isaiah 8:17\x*
\q2 Not just this, and also,
\q1 “I and the children
\q2 God gave to me are here”\x + \xo 2:13 \xt Isaiah 8:18\x*
\m like-that he is saying.
\p
\v 14 Because those who are called children have a body, Jesus became like us in every way and came. He, by his death, Satan (who is) the one who has authority over death should be destroyed so saying like this he did.
\v 15 Because of this he gave salvation to people who live their lifetime like slaves in fear of death.
\v 16 Because Jesus did not come in order to help God's angels but he came to help Abraham's descendants.\fig |cn01700b.jpg|col|||Jesus is not ashamed to call everyone his brothers|2:16\fig*
\v 17 Because of this, it was necessary for Jesus to be like us in every way. By that he could be our faithful and merciful High Priest before God. Then he could offer a sacrifice that would pay the ransom for our sins.
\v 18 Because he suffered troubles and overcame, now he can help those who are facing troubles of suffering.
\c 3
\s Jesus is greater than Moses
\p
\v 1 Therefore you brothers-and-sisters who God has called in order to stay in heaven! You have accepted Jesus, the \w messenger|Apostles\w* and high priest, who God sent. You remember and think about him.
\v 2 Moses faithfully completed whatever God gave him to do. Like that Jesus also faithfully did whatever God gave him to do.
\v 3 (People) respect the owner of the house more than the house (itself). Like that Jesus is more honoured than Moses like-that he earned a good name.
\v 4 Because someone has built each and every house but it is God who created everything.
\v 5 For all God's people Moses worked like a faithful servant. The things he (Moses) did were only true examples of what God would speak in the future.
\v 6 But Christ having become the authority over God's people is God's faithful son. If we believe that we will surely get salvation and if we remain strong in our faith (then) we will continue to be his household\f * \fr 3:6 \ft or it says God's house.\f* members.
\s Giving warning to those whose hearts are sliding away
\p
\v 7-8 For that reason God's \w Holy Spirit\w* said like this:
\q1 “Your ancestors rose up against me in the wilderness and
\q2 having become opposed were testing me.
\q1 If you hear my message today (emp),
\q2 just as your ancestors made their hearts stubborn, don't do like them.
\q1
\v 9 \fig |co00621b.jpg|span|||The people worshipping idols having forgotten God|3:9\fig* Having seen the miraculous deeds I did for forty years,
\q2 they tested my patience in the wilderness”
\q1
\v 10 “Due to that reason,
\q2 I became angry with those people.
\q1 ‘Their hearts slid away from me.
\q2 They did not accept the way in which I said they should go’.
\q1
\v 11 For that reason
\q1 ‘I will never allow them
\q2 to come to my resting place’
\q1 like-that in anger I took an oath”\x + \xo 3:11 \xt Psalms 95:7-11\x*
\m God said like that.
\p
\v 12 Be careful! My brothers-and-sisters! Make sure that no one from among you has an evil heart (which) slides away and stops trusting in the living God.
\v 13 And also, whenever you hear the scriptures saying ‘today's day (emp)’ in God's word, keep on encouraging one another each day to live in a good way. Then your you will not be trapped in sin and your hearts will not change to be (hard) like stones.
\v 14 Because if we remain strong in that faith from when we first believed until we die, then we will be one in Christ.
\v 15 Just as was said before:
\q1 “If you hear God's message today (emp),
\q2 just as your ancestors having become opposed
\q1 made their hearts stubborn, don't do like them.”\x + \xo 3:15 \xt Psalms 95:7-8\x*
\p
\v 16 Who were the ones who even having heard God's word opposed? Were they not the ones that Moses brought (out) from Egypt?
\v 17 On whom was God's anger for forty years? Was it not on the ones having sinned and died in the wilderness?
\v 18 About those who having knowingly slid away, “I will never allow them to come to my resting place” did he not make an oath? Yes he made [an oath]!
\v 19 Having seen all this, we know that without believing they could not enter that place of rest.
\c 4
\s The promised rest for God's people
\p
\v 1 The vow about going to God's resting place is unchanged. Because of this let us stay with fear and concentration so that no one from among you should leave the chance of going there.
\v 2 Just as we heard about the good news, those ancestors heard about the message of rest. But they did not put their trust in it. Therefore that message was useless for them.
\v 3 We (who) put our trust in the good news will surely be able to go to God's resting place. But those who don't believe,
\q1 “‘I will never allow them
\q2 to come to my resting place’
\q1 like-that in anger I took an oath”\x + \xo 4:3 \xt Psalms 95:11\x*
\m God said like that.
\p But we know that this resting place that is there now was there ever since creating the world.
\v 4 But about the rest day, “After God finished creating creation, he took rest on the seventh day”\x + \xo 4:4 \xt Genesis 2:2\x* it is written like that.
\v 5 And another time, “I will never allow them to come to my resting place”.
\p
\v 6 Before this our ancestors who have gone without believing in the good news did not get a chance in order to go to that resting place. But there is a chance for some people to go to that resting place.
\v 7 For this reason God has chosen another day. That he calls ‘today's day’. Just as I wrote to you before, after many years,
\q1 “If you hear my message today (emp),
\q2 don't let your hearts to become stubborn”\x + \xo 4:7 \xt Psalms 95:7,8\x*
\m like-that he caused him to speak through David.
\v 8 If Joshua had given rest to them God would not have told them about another day of rest.
\v 9 Therefore just as God took rest on the seventh day, that “rest day” remains for his believers.
\v 10 Just as God rested from his work his believers after having gone to the rest place their work will stop.
\v 11 He who does not follow as God says, he will be disobedient like (his) ancestors - the people of Israel. Therefore let us all try diligently to go to that resting place.
\p
\v 12 Because God's word is living and powerful. That word is even more sharp than a two-sided sword. Just as that sword separates joints and bone-marrow, like that having also exposed the inner thoughts of a person's spirit and soul, it judges [them].
\v 13 There is nothing in this world that can be hidden from God's sight. He can see everything clearly like it is spread out in front of his eyes. We will have to tell about ourselves to God who sees like that.
\s Jesus is the high priest
\p
\v 14 Jesus who has gone to heaven is God's son. He is the high priest of us all. \fig |cn01738b.jpg|col|||The high priest Jesus with the people|4:14\fig* Therefore let us stay firmly without leaving the faith that we accepted before everyone.
\v 15 Having understood our weaknesses (without strength), our high priest will sympathize with us. Because Jesus suffered all kinds of tests like us, but he did not do any sin.
\v 16 Therefore having got courage let us go near\f * \fr 4:16 \ft Near to God's throne of grace.\f* to God. If we go like that then we will receive God's compassion and grace just at the right time.
\c 5
\s No one can take the position of the high priest
\p
\v 1 The people chose a high priest from (among) them. He gives offerings and sacrifices for sin in God's presence on behalf of the people.
\v 2 Even this high priest himself is weak in many ways. Therefore, on those who have sinned without knowing, he will deal gently.
\v 3 For this reason that high priest having made a sacrifice for his own sins, must also give a sacrifice for the people's sins.
\p
\v 4 No man can take on himself the position of being a high priest. Just as God called and chose Aaron for the first high priest, like that he calls and chooses other high priests.
\v 5 Even Christ did not take for himself the high priest's priesthood. But God said to him,
\q1 “You are my son.
\q2 Today I have fathered you”\x + \xo 5:5 \xt Psalms 2:7\x*
\m he said like that.
\v 6 And in another place,
\q1 “Having become like Melchizedek
\q2 you will be a priest forever!”\x + \xo 5:6 \xt Psalms 110:4\x*
\m like-that he chose.
\p
\v 7 While Jesus was living on earth he prayed and requested crying out with tears to God who was able to save him from death. Having taking (into account) his inner devotion, God heard his prayer.
\v 8 Even having become God's son he learned his father's discipline and how to suffer troubles.
\v 9 In this way God, accepted him in as a high priest being perfect in all ways. He stands as the foundation to give eternal life to everyone who obeys (holds onto) his word.
\v 10 God chose Jesus as a high priest like Melchizedek.
\s Once again you have become infants
\p
\v 11 There is so much more to be told about this. But it is difficult to explain in detail about them. Because you have become lazy to learn about God's message.
\v 12 By this time you should have become the religious-teaching teachers. But someone else has to teach you God's first teachings. Those teachings are like milk but the advanced teachings are like solid food. You cannot eat solid food but you have to still drink milk like newborn girls and newborn boys.
\v 13 Those who just drink milk are still infants. Therefore they don't know (the difference) between good and bad.
\v 14 Solid food is for only those who are mature and are walking having learned (what is) good and bad through training.
\c 6
\p
\v 1 So, without telling the first told teachings about Christ again and again, let us leave them and go forward and become as mature people. Repenting from sinful activities leading towards death and putting trust in God,
\v 2 the teaching about baptism, putting hands on the head, and in the future \w resurrection|Raising back to life\w* and God finally judging them, there is no need to tell you again and again about these kinds of first important teachings of Christ.
\v 3 Instead of this if God gives us a chance to go forward, let us go.
\s About those who are sliding away from faith in God
\p
\v 4-5 Having caused those people, who have sliden away from faith in God, to turn back, how can we make them feel sorry? Having earlier known God's truth, they have experienced God's blessings, having partaken of the \w Holy Spirit\w*, having experienced the goodness of God's message, they know about the powerful deeds which God will do in the future.
\v 6 Even having taken all these experiences, we cannot cause those who have sliden away from trust in God to turn back and feel sorry. Because of this, having nailed God's son on the log\f * \fr 6:6 \ft A log on which to hang people to take their life.\f* once again, they are shaming that son in front of people.
\p
\v 7 Those people are like bad soil. As the soil of any field having soaked in the water from the rains, gives a good crop to the farmer, that soil gets God's blessing.
\v 8 But instead of this if the soil of that field sprouts thorny plants and grasses and creepers, the farmer\f * \fr 6:8 \ft here it means God.\f* will soon curse and burn it saying that land is useless.
\s God will never forget you
\p
\v 9 My dear brothers! You are doing good works. because God saved you already. Therefore these warnings are not about you.
\v 10 As you have done good works and now you are doing works of service with love for God's devotees in the name of God, God will not forget you. Because He is righteous one.
\v 11-12 Don't be lazy. But like hard workers, you should continue doing these works, with patient faith until the end, without letting go of the salvation-giving hope, in order to get God's promises.
\s God's vow
\p
\v 13-14 Then because there is no one greater than God he took an oath on his own name and said to Abraham “Truly, I will bless you and increase your descendants”\x + \xo 6:13-14 \xt Genesis 22:17\x* like-that he promised.
\v 15 Abraham was patiently looking for that. So God fulfilled that promise.
\p
\v 16 When there is an argument coming between two parties, in order to settle (the matter) one of the parties will make an oath in someone's name who is greater than them. Then, having understood the truth of that oath, the argument ends.
\v 17 In order to say to those receiving that promise “I will never change the promise that I gave”, God took an oath in his own name.
\v 18 God's promise and oath, these two will not change. God cannot lie about these things. God's desire is that those people who are going toward eternal life should go with even more encouragement.
\v 19 This hope of eternal life having made us strong people, keeps our spirit from sliding away like a ship's ‘anchor’,\f * \fr 6:19 \ft A ship's anchor is made out of iron. In order to stop the ship they let that go (drop) it into the water. Then, that [anchor] having either got stuck in the rocks or in some hard ground, the ship stays in one place without being tossed here and there.\f* enabling us to go inside God's dwelling place of heaven.
\v 20 Because ahead of us Jesus our high priest has entered inside that heaven on our behalf. Like Melchizedek Jesus has become an eternal high priest.
\c 7
\s God's priest Melchizedek
\p
\v 1 That Melchizedek, king of Salem, was the priest of the most high God. \fig |cn01603b.jpg|col|||The Priest Melchisedek|7:1\fig* While Abraham was coming back\f * \fr 7:1 \ft Abraham rescued and brought his older brother's son Lot from the hand of King of Elam. (\xt Genesis 14:17-24\xt*)\f* having won the fight over other kings, Melchizedek met and blessed him.
\v 2 Abraham gave Melchizedek one tenth from what he himself won and brought. ‘Melchizedek’ means righteous king and ‘Salem's king’ also means king of peace.
\v 3 No one knows who his forefathers and mother and father are. No one even knows about his birth and death. He is like God's son being a priest forever.
\p
\v 4 You should know how great that Melchizedek is. Because even our ancestor Abraham, gave Melchizedek one tenth from what he won at war.
\v 5 It is in Moses' law\f * \fr 7:5 \ft The commands that God caused Moses to write.\f* that Levi's descendants should run the priesthood and those who are born as Abraham's descendants, even though they are brothers, should give the priests of the descendants of Levi one tenth.
\v 6 Melchizedek is not Levi's descendant. But even then, he took promises from God. Melchizedek took one tenth from Abraham and blessed Abraham.
\v 7 There is no doubt, the person giving the blessing is greater than the person taking the blessing.
\v 8 The descendants of Levi who were living and will die are taking one tenth. But it is said that even Melchizedek who lives forever took one tenth.
\v 9 One way of seeing this is that, even the one tenth receiving person Levi, we can say he gave one tenth to Melchizedek through Abraham.
\v 10 Because when Abraham met Melchizedek, Levi was not yet even born\f * \fr 7:10 \fq Levi was not yet even born \ft That Levi was in the loins of his ancestor Abraham.\f* into Abraham's descendants.
\s Jesus is a priest like Melchizedek
\p
\v 11 In Moses' law it says Levi's descendants should run the priesthood. But the works of those priests are not able to be perfect. If their works were perfect then God would have sent a priest like Aaron.\f * \fr 7:11 \ft Aaron was of the clan of Levi.\f* But why is it necessary for another priest like Melchizedek\f * \fr 7:11 \ft Melchizedek was not of the clan of Levi.\f* to come?
\v 12 If the priesthood changes then the law should also change.
\v 13 These words are telling about the different tribe-person Jesus. The people of this tribe have never worked as priests at the sacrifice giving place of God's temple.
\v 14 Our Lord Jesus came from the tribe of Judah and we know that Moses did not say anywhere that this tribe should become priests.
\p
\v 15 The saying that he will become a priest like Melchizedek the Lord has fulfilled.
\v 16 He did not become a priest from the tribe of Levi as prescribed by the law but he was able to become a priest because of the power of his everlasting life.
\v 17 because,
\q1 “Having become like Melchizedek
\q2 you will be a priest forever!”\x + \xo 7:17 \xt Psalms 110:4\x*
\m like-that the scripture is saying.
\v 18-19 Moses law could not make anything perfect. Saying that that law is weak and is worthless God put it aside. Instead of this, the Lord gave a better hope than that. By following this (hope) we can go near to God.
\v 20-21 Not only that, God took an oath, but he did not take an oath for any other priest. In the holy scriptures,
\q1 “The Lord God took an oath
\q2 and he will not change his mind.
\q1 You will remain a priest forever!”\x + \xo 7:20-21 \xt Psalms 110:4\x*
\m God said like that to him.
\v 22 By this oath Jesus became the guarantee that the new covenant is better than the old covenant.
\p
\v 23 And one more difference is that many people become priests but death stops them from becoming priests forever.
\v 24 But because Jesus is without death he will be a high priest forever.
\v 25 Therefore Jesus always saves whoever comes to God's presence through him. This Jesus will always be alive in order to plead to God on their behalf.
\p
\v 26 This kind of high priest is the holy one, the one without sin, the blameless one, (who does) not associate with sinners, (he) is the one honoured in heaven.
\v 27 This Jesus neither has to give daily sacrifices for his own sins nor for the people's sins like the other high priests. Because he gave himself as a sacrifice only once for the sins of all people.
\v 28 Moses' law chose high priests that were powerless. But the oath that came after the law chose God's son as a high priest. Not only that, he became and remains forever a perfect high priest.
\c 8
\s The new covenant: Jesus is our high priest
\p
\v 1 From what we told, the important message is that Jesus is sitting as a high priest for us at the right hand side of the great and all-powerful God's throne in heaven.
\v 2 He is serving inside the true worshipping tent at the Most Holy Place. Men did not make this worshipping tent but the Lord\f * \fr 8:2 \ft God\f* made it.
\p
\v 3 Each and every high priest after being chosen needs to offer offerings and sacrifices for the forgiveness of sin. Like that it was also necessary for our high priest Jesus to give something to be offered.
\v 4 If he was in this world now he would not even have become an ordinary priest. Because there are offering-giving priests according to Moses' law.
\v 5 Those priests are serving at a place which is only a duplicate image\f * \fr 8:5 \ft Like a shadow.\f* of the Most Holy Place in heaven. Before Moses put up the worshipping tent (God said) “Carefully make everything just as I showed in the example when you were on the mountain”\x + \xo 8:5 \xt Exodus 25:40\x* like-that God warned him.
\p
\v 6 But now even more than the service of those priests, Jesus is at the Most Holy Place doing [the work of] service given (by God). Not only that, Jesus has become the mediator of a new covenant which is better than the old covenant. This covenant stands on better promises than the old covenant.
\p
\v 7 If that old covenant was without any fault\f * \fr 8:7 \ft This means: There was nothing wrong with that old covenant, but that covenant was just not able to fulfil that which it was supposed to do.\f* then there is no need for a new covenant.
\v 8 But God while pointing out the faults of his people said,
\q1 “Look! In the future with the people of Israel
\q2 and the people of Judah I will put a new covenant.
\q1
\v 9 Having carefully led their ancestors,
\q2 I brought them from Egypt.
\q1 This new covenant will not be like the covenant
\q2 I made with them at that time.
\q1 Because they were not following the covenant that I put.
\q2 Therefore I ignored them.
\q1
\v 10 But after those days have passed, this is the new covenant
\q2 I have decided with the people of Israel.
\q1 I will make their minds
\q2 remember the commands of my law.
\q1 I will put them [the commands] in their heart.
\q1 I will be [remain] their God.
\q2 They will be [remain] my people.
\q1
\v 11 At that time, it will not be necessary to say ‘know about God’
\q2 to any neighbours or relatives.
\q1 Everyone, without any difference,
\q2 will know about me.
\q1
\v 12 with mercy I will never again remember
\q2 their sins and those wicked deeds”\x + \xo 8:12 \xt Jeremiah 31:31-34\x*
\m like-that he caused to write.
\p
\v 13 God called this ‘the new covenant’ because the first covenant has become old. Whatever becomes old is ready to disappear.
\c 9
\s The old rules for worshipping
\p
\v 1 The first covenant that God gave the Israelite people had rules about the worshipping tent made by human hands and about rules (for worship).\f * \fr 9:1 \ft Refer to the last section of this book to see how the Jewish people used to worship God.\f* \fig |co00843b.tif|col|||Offering altar|9:1\fig*
\v 2 In the middle of that worshipping tent they hung a curtain and made two parts. In the front part was the lampstand and the table for putting the offering bread. They used to call this part the holy place.
\v 3 They used to call that part behind the curtain the Most \w Holy\w* Place.
\v 4 In that part there was an incense burning altar made of gold and the covenant box. That box was completely covered with gold. Inside that box there used to be a gold pot with mana\f * \fr 9:4 \ft The food called manna that God miraculously sent to the Israelite people to eat in the wilderness while coming from Egypt. (\xt Exodus 16:32-34\xt*)\f* in it, Aaron's sprouted stick\f * \fr 9:4 \ft The meaning of this stick was to remind the people that Aaron was God's chosen priest. (\xt Numbers 16–17\xt*)\f*, and two slate-like carved rocks on which the commands were written.
\v 5 The top part of that box's lid [is] called the place for forgiving sins.\f * \fr 9:5 \ft the mercy seat.\f* The guarding figures\f * \fr 9:5 \ft called Cherubim (which are) like angels.\f* which show God's glorious light covered that place with their wings. There is no time now in order to tell in detail about all these things.
\p
\v 6 After preparing everything like this the priests used to go into the front portion of the worshipping tent and do their daily rituals.
\v 7 But only the high priest used to go once each year to the Most Holy Place behind the curtain holding the blood in order to give an offering for his (own) sins and for the sins the people did without knowing.\x + \xo 9:7 \xt Exodus 30:10; Leviticus 16:2,14,15,29,34\x*
\v 8 Considering all these things, the \w Holy Spirit\w* was showing that as long as there is this kind of worshipping tent place, the way to heaven's Most Holy Place will not open.
\v 9 All that is just an example of what is happening at this present time. Those offerings and sacrifices are not able to free the conscience of the worshipping ones from guilt at all.
\v 10 Meaning, food and drink offerings and deeds for becoming ritually clean are only useful for the body. These deeds are only useful until God's new covenant has come.
\s Jesus' offering of blood
\p
\v 11 Christ having become a high priest brought us good blessings. He went to the place of the very great and perfect worshipping tent in heaven in order to serve. That place is not made by man meaning that it is not of this world.
\v 12 Christ did not go there taking either the blood of goats nor the blood of calves. But having given his own blood, one time only, he went to that Most Holy Place. Through that we got eternal salvation.
\v 13 According to Moses' law, if the blood of goats and bulls and ashes of calves are sprinkled on an unclean person only their outer body is made ritually clean.
\v 14 But how much more ritually clean Christ's blood makes our fully sinful consciences. Meaning that, through the power of the eternal Holy Spirit, sinless Jesus sacrificed his own forever-living spirit for God. In order that we worship the living God, Christ did like this.
\p
\v 15 For this reason Christ became and stands as a mediator of this new covenant. And for those who are called, he makes them partakers in the everlasting blessings that God promised. For this reason he gave up his life to pay for the sins of sinners according to the first covenant. \fig |cn02103b.jpg|col|||Writing a letter|9:15\fig*
\p
\v 16-17 If someone writes their will, that will is useless until his death. Only after he dies that will is useful.
\v 18 Because of this the first covenant is useless without giving the blood of animals.
\v 19 Moses after telling all the people the commands of the religious law, having mixed the blood of calves and goats in water, and having tied red wool to the stalk of a plant,\f * \fr 9:19 \ft The stick of a plant called hyssop.\f* he sprinkled it on the book of religious law and on all of the people.
\v 20 He said “This is the blood of the covenant that God has given you to follow”.\x + \xo 9:20 \xt Exodus 24:8\x*
\v 21 In that same way he sprinkled that blood at the worshipping tent and (ceremonial) things used while performing service.
\v 22 According to Moses' law, almost everything should be made ritually clean with blood. Without shedding of blood sins will not get forgiveness.
\p
\v 23 Through this, in order for the man-made duplicate images of heaven to become ritually clean, it was necessary to offer animal sacrifices. But in order to make ritually clean those things in heaven, even better sacrifices than the blood of animals are needed.
\v 24 On earth the Most Holy Place is only a mask of the true Most Holy Place in heaven. Christ did not go inside the man-made holy place, but now on our behalf having gone to heaven he stood in front of God.
\v 25 Just as the high priest every year goes with the blood of animals to the Most Holy Place that Jesus did not enter heaven in order to offer himself as a sacrifice again and again.
\v 26 If Christ had to give a sacrifice like that how many times would he have given his life since the creation of the universe until now. But now he came at this end time in order to give himself as an offering for everyone's sin only once to remain for ever.
\v 27 Each and everyone must die once. After that God will judge them.
\v 28 Therefore Christ only once gave himself as a sacrificial offering for everyone's sins. He will come back once again. Not in order to take away sin on himself, but he will come in order to save those people who are eagerly waiting for him.
\c 10
\p
\v 1 Moses' law is only like a shadow of the good blessings to happen in future, but it is not the true image of that. Therefore offering the same kinds of sacrifices each year according to that law, can never make those devotees completely pure.
\v 2 If those made the devotees truly pure, they would not have had guilty feelings in their consciences and they would have stopped giving the sacrificial offerings.
\v 3 But instead of that, those sacrifices given cause them to remember their sins every year.
\v 4 Because neither the blood of bulls nor the blood of goats can ever pay off for sins.
\v 5 For that reason when Christ was coming into this world [he] said to God like this:
\q1 “You did not request
\q2 for sacrifices or offerings
\q1 but you created a body
\q2 for me to give (as an) offering for you.
\q1
\v 6 Giving burnt sacrifices or,
\q2 the sacrifices that are payment for sin
\q2 did not give you happiness.
\q1
\v 7 then I said, ‘God, look!
\q2 I came here in order to fulfil your wish.
\q1 They wrote about me in the scriptures’”\x + \xo 10:7 \xt Psalms 40:6-8\x*
\m like-that I said.
\p
\v 8 Even though it is written in Moses' law that you should give sacrifices, [grain] offerings, offerings of burnt animals and other sacrifices as payment for sin, Christ said “These did not give you happiness”.
\v 9 After saying like that “God, look! I came here in order to fulfil your wish”. In order to start the second covenant he stopped the first covenant.
\v 10 Because Jesus Christ, in order to fulfil God's wish, gave his body as a sacrificial offering only once to remain for ever and made us ritually clean.
\p
\v 11 Every priest must stand in order to do religious service every day. He goes on giving again and again those sacrifices but these sacrifices cannot wash-away sins.
\v 12 But the high priest Jesus, having given a sacrifice for our sins, only once to remain for ever, sat down at God's right-hand side.
\v 13 Since then Christ is watching for God to suppress his enemies and put them like a footstool for his feet.
\v 14 Having given a sacrificial offering only once he made us, who are being made ritually clean, perfect forever.
\v 15-16 About being perfect:
\q1 “‘After that I will establish
\q2 a new covenant with them.
\q1 I will make their minds
\q2 remember the commands of my law.
\q1 I will make them [the people] follow them [the commands]’
\q2 like-that God will say”\x + \xo 10:15-16 \xt Jeremiah 31:33 \x*
\m having said the \w Holy Spirit\w* gave us witness.
\p
\v 17 And afterwards, “‘I will never remember their sins and those wicked deeds’\x + \xo 10:17 \xt Jeremiah 31:34\x* like-that God tells” having said the Holy Spirit told.
\v 18 Due to God having forgiven all those sins, it is no longer ever necessary to offer sacrifices for them.
\s Without leaving the faith let's go near to God
\p
\v 19 Brothers-and-sisters! Jesus gave his blood as a sacrifice. Through this we are able to go without fear to heaven's Most Holy Place.
\v 20 Because at the time of Jesus death, God tore (in two) the curtain that was there at the most holy place in that temple. Now through Jesus' body, with the new life we got, we can go without fear to where God is.\fig |cn01843b.tif|col|||The temple's curtain tearing from top to bottom|10:19-20\fig*
\v 21 And not only that, (he) our high priest is ruling over God's people.
\v 22 He has made our consciences ritually clean with his blood and he washed our bodies with fresh water. Therefore let us go in God's presence with sincere hearts.
\p
\v 23 He who has promised to us is trustworthy. Therefore let us stay courageously without leaving the faithful hope that we have told to others.
\v 24 Let us think about how we can love each other and cause (each other to) do good works.
\v 25 Some people are in the habit of not coming in order to worship God. The main thing is that the day of the Lord Jesus' second coming is getting nearer. Therefore having all come together let us keep on telling ourselves and each other to go forward in a good way.
\p
\v 26 Even after knowing the truth, if we intentionally go on sinning, we can't give any sacrifices for forgiving those sins.
\v 27 Instead of this, for those who have become God's enemies, [they] will fear that he will judge them and destroy them with raging fire.
\v 28 With just two or three witnesses they used to put the punishment of death on [anyone] who opposed Moses' law, without showing any mercy on them.
\v 29 So now abusing God's son, calling as unholy that covenant of blood which made [us] holy, and on the one who shames the grace-showing spirit of God, you think how much more severe the punishment should be put.
\q1
\v 30 Like that, God “The work of taking revenge is mine.
\q2 I am the one who repays that”
\m he said like that. And again,
\q1 “The Lord will judge over his own people”\x + \xo 10:30 \xt Deuteronomy 32:35,36; Psalms 135:14\x*
\m like-that we also know he told.
\p
\v 31 The punishment is very frightening for people who are caught with sin by the living God.
\p
\v 32 Remember the first days that you followed God's way. During those days how many difficulties you bore. But even then you accepted them.
\v 33 Sometimes you bore shame and persecution in front of everyone. And sometimes you stood close to people suffering those difficulties.
\v 34 Not only that you treated with mercy those who suffered in jail and even when your possessions were plundered you joyfully accepted it. Because you knew that the things God has given are much better and last forever compared to what was plundered from you.
\p
\v 35 Therefore whatever happens don't lose your faith. Through this a good reward will be found.
\v 36 You must stay with a firm grip. You should walk according to God's wish. After that God will give you that which he has promised. Because, in the holy scriptures,
\q1
\v 37 “He is coming soon,
\q2 he will come without delay.
\q1
\v 38 Whoever God accepts as a righteous person through faith,
\q2 he will live.
\q2 But if anyone from among them
\q2 turns back it makes me sad”\x + \xo 10:38 \xt Habakkuk 2:3,4\x*
\m it is written like that.
\p
\v 39 Even then we are not like those who having slid away will be destroyed. Instead of this we are like those who are being saved by faith.
\c 11
\s Faith
\p
\v 1 Trusting that we will surely get what we hoped for and trusting that things we cannot see are truly there, faith is.
\v 2 Our ancestors had this kind of faith. For that reason only God was proud of with them. \fig |co00604b.jpg|col|||Creating the animals and plants|11:2\fig*
\p
\v 3 By faith we understand that, God created the universe with his word. (This) means the visible was created from the invisible.\x + \xo 11:3 \xt Genesis 1:1; Psalms 33:6,9; John 1:3\x*
\p
\v 4 By faith Abel, gave a better offering to God than Cain. God having been pleased with Abel's given sacrifice more than Cain's given sacrifice, he accepted Abel as a righteous person. How faith should be, Abel, even after his death, his faith teaches us.
\p
\v 5 By Enoch's faith God took him to heaven while alive. For that reason no one found his dead-body.\x + \xo 11:5 \xt Genesis 5:24\x* Before being taken to heaven Enoch pleased God, it is written like that in scripture.
\v 6 No one can please God without faith. Someone who wants to be God's devotee must believe [that] God is present and [that] he [God] will reward he who seeks [him].
\p
\v 7 By faith Noah, made a big boat in order to save his family from the flood water. \fig |co00626b.jpg|col|||Noah made a boat to save his family|11:7\fig* Noah obeyed according to what God had warned would happen in the future. The faith that he had, proved that all the people of the world had done wrong. Through that faith he became a righteous person.\x + \xo 11:7 \xt Genesis 6:13-22\x*
\p
\v 8 By faith Abraham, obeyed God's word and having left his country he went, without even knowing where he was going, in order to take the country that God said he would give like an inheritance.\x + \xo 11:8 \xt Genesis 12:1-5\x*
\v 9 By faith Abraham lived in the promised land that God gave and the inheritors Isaac and Jacob, they all lived in tents.\x + \xo 11:9 \xt Genesis 35:27\x* He lived like that as a foreigner in a tent.
\v 10 Because Abraham was looking forward with faith to the forever staying heavenly city with foundations built by God.
\p
\v 11 By faith Abraham's wife Sarah, even though she was old and barren, by putting faith on the promise that God gave, she was able to become a mother.
\v 12 When Abraham was too old to give birth to children, countless descendants were born, like the stars in the sky and like the grains of sand on the shore of the sea, just as God promised.
\p
\v 13 All these people, having kept their faith in the promise that God gave, died without the promise being fulfilled in their lifetime. But, having received an experience themselves, they accepted that promise. They agreed that on this earth they would be living like foreigners.
\v 14 If we see their way of talking we know that they were searching for their own country.
\v 15 If they were to think about the country that they had left they [might have gone back there] had a chance to go back there.
\v 16 Instead of [thinking like] this they hoped for an even better country, meaning to go to heaven. Therefore calling [him] their God, it pleased God. Not only this, God built a city for his people. \fig |co00663b.jpg|col|||Abraham ready to sacrifice Isaac|11:16\fig*

But before that God had given a promise to Abraham saying “Your descendants will be counted through Isaac's lineage”.\x + \xo 11:17-18 \xt Genesis 21:12\x* But even then he was ready to even sacrifice his only living son.
\v 19 Abraham knew that God can cause the dead to become alive. God gave Isaac back to Abraham, as if he was dead and \w raised|Raising back to life\w* to life.
\p
\v 20 By faith Isaac, blessed Jacob and Esau regarding their future. \fig |co00754b.jpg|col|||Jacob blessing Joseph's sons|11:20\fig*
\p
\v 21 By faith Jacob, before his death, while he was blessing both of Joseph's sons, he leaned on his stick\f * \fr 11:21 \fq he leaned on his stick \ft In the Hebrew language the word for bed and the word for stick are much alike (\xt Genesis 47:30-31\xt*).\f* and worshipped God.
\p
\v 22 By faith Joseph, before his death, was able to tell regarding the people of Israel going out from Egypt. Not only this, he also commanded them what (they) should do with his bones.
\p
\v 23 By faith Moses' parents, after his birth, hid him for three months. Having known that he was not a ordinary baby-boy they protected him without paying attention to the command the king gave.
\p
\v 24 By faith Moses, after maturing, did not accept to be called a son of King Pharaoh's daughter.
\v 25 On this earth for a short time instead of getting the pleasure from sin, he came forward in order to suffer troubles along with God's people.
\v 26 Looking forward to the reward of it (the suffering), he understood that, compared to Egypt's wealth, it was better to suffer for Christ.
\p
\v 27 By faith Moses, left the country of Egypt without fearing whether the king would be angry. He did not go back having strengthened his grip on faith because he understood that it was as if he had seen the invisible God.
\v 28 By faith Moses, in order that the angel of death should not kill the first-born sons of the people of Israel, having commanded to put blood above the doorways, established the Passover\f * \fr 11:28 \ft This festival, which runs for seven days, was to remember God's work of having delivered and brought the Israelite people from slavery in the country of Egypt.\f* festival. \fig |co00818b.jpg|col|||The Israelite people crossing the red sea on dry ground|11:28\fig*

\p
\v 30 By faith the people of Israel, walked around the city of Jericho for seven days. Then the walls of that city fell.
\p
\v 31 By faith even Rahab the prostitute, having called (them) into her house gave hospitality to those messengers that Joshua had sent. Because of this she did not die along with God's enemies.
\p
\v 32 And who else should I tell you about? I don't have time to talk about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.
\v 33 All of them by putting their trust in God were able to defeat other kingdoms. They ruled with justice. They were able to receive the promises given by God. They were able to close the mouths of lions.
\v 34 They were able to extinguish scary fires. They were able to escape from striking swords. Those without strength changed to be like strong people. In battle they showed their great power and defeated other countries' soldiers.
\v 35 Because of putting their faith in God some women were able to see the \w resurrection|Raising back to life\w* of their close relatives.
\p But others, because of their faith in God, bore many difficulties and troubles. Suffering like that they died holding onto the hope that, after their resurrection they would have a good life in heaven.
\v 36 From among them their enemies having teased them beat them with whips. And having caught others they caused them to be thrown into jail.
\v 37 Some people were killed - by stoning, by cutting into two pieces with saws. By striking with swords. And other believers, being poor, wandered around wearing goat and sheep skins. Others oppressed and gave trouble to them.
\v 38 They lived in barren place, in the mountains, in gaps in the rocks and in caves. This world is not good enough for people like them.
\p
\v 39 God was pleased with all of their faith. But no one received the promise that God gave them at that time.
\v 40 God, having earlier prepared and kept something for us better than everything else, has done this so that having gathered us together along with them he will fulfil that promise.
\c 12
\s God is our father
\p
\v 1 There are so many of God's devotees around us giving witness. Therefore let us go forward overcoming the hurdles that come in the way. Leaving behind our sins that strongly cling to us, let us run forward with strong persistence (determination) in this running race.
\v 2 Let us put our eyes on Jesus. He only is the initiator and fulfilling one of the faith in us. \fig |cn01833b.tif|span|||Jesus carrying the log|12:2\fig* In order for himself to get happiness in the future, he even accepted to give his life on that log. At that time he did not count the shame that came on himself. Now he is sitting at the right hand side of God's throne.
\v 3 Think carefully [about] how Jesus patiently bore that grief which was given to him by sinners in anger. Only then will you be able to stay tirelessly and without leaving your faith.
\v 4 Until now you have not needed to shed your blood in the war against sin.
\p
\v 5 Have you completely forgotten the encouraging message that God said considering everyone as his sons?
\q1 “My son, don't neglect
\q2 the teachings [refering to discipline] told by the Lord.
\q1 If the Lord should correct your sin,
\q2 don't feel sad in your mind.
\q1
\v 6 Because whoever God loves
\q2 he will give punishment to him.
\q1 Not only that, whoever he accepts as a son,
\q2 he will give punishment to him”\x + \xo 12:6 \xt Proverbs 3:11,12\x*
\m it is written like that.
\p
\v 7 Considering that these are the difficulties of disciplining, you should walk while bearing the troubles. God considers you like his sons. In order to discipline his son, every father gives punishments.
\v 8 You should learn that if whoever from among you does not learn discipline from God, (then) he is not your father and you are not his true sons.
\v 9 Our fathers who gave us birth give us training in discipline. Because of that we respect them much. So in order to live forever, think how much more we should respect our spiritual father God.
\v 10 For a few years our parents will teach us discipline in the way that they understand. But for our own good in the future, in order to make us holy like himself God teaches us discipline.
\v 11 While taking these punishment it is sad. It won't be happy. But after that those who learn through those trials will get fruits called peace and righteousness.
\p
\v 12 Therefore strengthen your weak hands and trembling knees.
\v 13 You make the walking way of faith straight. Then those with less faith will see your faith and they will become strong in their faith.\x + \xo 12:13 \xt Proverbs 4:26\x*
\s Warnings to God's enemies
\p
\v 14 Showing peace to everyone try to live a holy life. Without having this holiness no one can see the Lord.
\v 15 See to it that not even one slides away from God's grace. If there is a trouble-maker among you he will make everyone unclean. You be careful about this.
\v 16 You see that no one among you is sexually immoral. You don't live like Esau who, without regard for God, for one single meal sold to his younger brother Jacob his own bigger position.
\v 17 You know the story that afterwards his father did not accept him when Esau went to take his blessing. He cried saying I should get that blessing. But the time had already passed to repent and receive the blessing.
\p
\v 18 The people of Israel came to the touchable and visible mountain of Sinai. That mountain was burning with fire and smoke was coming out, with darkness and completely stormy. But you have not come to a mountain like that.
\v 19 Having heard the sound of the horn and terrifying voice coming from that mountain, they were afraid and pleaded not to hear that voice.
\v 20 Then God gave the command that if any animal even touches this mountain that the animal should be killed by stoning. They could not bear that command.\x + \xo 12:20 \xt Exodus 19:12-13\x*
\v 21 About that which was seen Moses said, “I am trembling with fear”.\x + \xo 12:21 \xt Deuteronomy 9:19 \x*
\p
\v 22 But you have come to the mountain of Zion. This is the living God's heavenly city of Jerusalem. You have come to the joyful gathering of thousands upon thousands of God's angels.
\v 23 You have been counted as the first-born church-people whose names are written in heaven. You have come to the God who judges over everything with authority. You have come to heaven to the spirits of people who have become righteous in all ways.
\v 24 You have come near to Jesus who has become the only mediator of the new covenant between God and people. His blood which makes holy, is not taking revenge like Abel's blood but tells about forgiveness.\f * \fr 12:24 \ft It says in the Greek, “You have come to the blood that speaks even better than Abel's blood”. Its meaning is written above.\f*
\p
\v 25 Stay alert! Don't reject the speaker (who is speaking) with you. The [Jewish] people of that time didn't care (about) the message Moses told in this world. Because of that they could not escape from punishment. So, now, if we don't care about the messages from heaven's speakers, we will certainly not be able to escape from punishment.
\v 26 At that time his voice caused an earthquake to come. But now he (promised), “Once again I will shake not only the earth but also the sky”\x + \xo 12:26 \xt Haggai 2:6\x* like-that he promised.
\v 27 “Once again” means that everything that has been created in the world will be destroyed. But eternal things will not change.
\p
\v 28 No one is able to shake the kingdom which we are receiving. Therefore having given thanks to God, let us worship that God with reverence and in the way that he desires.
\v 29 Because we know that “Our God is like a burning consuming destroying fire.\f * \fr 12:29 \fq Our God is like a burning consuming destroying fire \ft If we do not do like that “Our God will destroy us in burning fire” we know.\f*”\x + \xo 12:29 \xt Deuteronomy 4:24\x*

\s How we should give happiness to God
\p
\v 1 Brothers-and-sisters! keep looking after the Lord's believers with love.
\v 2 Some of them unknowingly were hospitable towards God's angels. Therefore don't forget to be hospitable to unknown believers of the Lord.
\v 3 Remember those who (because of their faith) have fallen into prison as if you yourselves were suffering in prison. In the same way remember those who are suffering with troubles as if you are suffering along with them.
\p
\v 4 All should respect the system of marriage. A husband and wife should trust each other. God will judge those who, after marriage, have sexually intercourse with someone else apart from their partner, and also [judge] those who have sexual intercourse before marriage.
\v 5 Live your life without desiring wealth. Be happy with whatever you have. because,
\q1 “I will never leave you.
\q2 I will never make you like someone all alone”\x + \xo 13:5 \xt Deuteronomy 31:6\x*
\m God said like that.
\p
\v 6 Therefore having courage,
\q1 “God is my helper.
\q2 I will not fear anything.
\q1 No-one can do anything to me”\x + \xo 13:6 \xt Psalms 118:6,7\x*
\m like-that we can say.
\p
\v 7 Remember those church-people elders who first taught God's message. And having learned their good way of life, live like them holding the faith.

\v 8 In ancient times, now and forever Jesus Christ will be the same without changing.
\v 9 Therefore you must be alert about different different teachings that cause sliding away. Rules about food will not strengthen our hearts. But only God's grace will give strength to our hearts. Those who follow those rules do not get any benefit.
\p
\v 10 The Jewish priests of the worshipping tent do not have the right to eat the offerings from our place of sacrifice.
\v 11 The High priest used to take the blood of animals into the Most Holy Place in order to pay for sins. They used to burn the bodies of those animals outside of the Israelite's campsite\x + \xo 13:11 \xt Leviticus 16:27\x*.
\v 12 So in the same way Jesus also having bore the sufferings outside the gates of Jerusalem city gave up his life in order to cleanse mankind from sin with his own blood.
\v 13 Therefore having gone to Jesus who is outside, let us share in his shame.
\v 14 This world is not a permanent city for us, but we are looking for a future city.\f * \fr 13:14 \ft An eternal home for us in heaven.\f*
\p
\v 15 Therefore instead of animal sacrifices let us continue to offer God a sacrifice of worship through what Jesus has done. A sacrifice of worship means [going on] confessing that Jesus is my Lord.
\v 16 Don't forget to look after others and to share what you have with them. These kinds of offerings give God much happiness.
\p
\v 17 You follow the instructions of the church-people leaders. It is their work to guard your spirits. They will have to give an account to God about you. If you follow as they have instructed, then they can do their work joyfully. I you don't follow as they have instructed, they will do their work with sadness. Then you will not get any benefit.
\p
\v 18 Pray for us. We are living respectfully in all ways, believing that there is no sin in our consciences.
\v 19 I am pleading with you that you pray for me until I have come to meet you again.
\s Ending prayer
\p
\v 20 Now, may our peace-giving God, who raised the Lord from death, help you. Jesus, like a good shepherd protecting all believers, through his own blood, fulfilled God's eternal covenant with us.
\v 21 I request that God would fulfil each and every good thing in you that he desires. I am also requesting that all of God's desires would be fulfilled among you through Jesus' hands. I am requesting that Jesus should get glorious honour generation after generation. Amen\f * \fr 13:21 \ft Means: let it happen as requested.\f*!
\s Closing words
\p
\v 22 My brothers-and-sisters! I am pleading that you carefully read these few words in this letter telling you to increase your faith.
\v 23 Our brother Timothy came out of prison. If he comes to me quickly, I will bring him with me to come and see you.
\v 24 Convey my wishes to the leaders and all God's devotees among you. The believers of the country of Italy are conveying their wishes to you.
\v 25 I am requesting that God's grace will be with you all.
