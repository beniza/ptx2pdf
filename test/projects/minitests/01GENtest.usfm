\c 1
\s This is a title
\p
\v 1 This is normal text. There are 4 hook positions: before, start, end,
after. I'm putting little NIV-style angle bracket markers around \beginadd T
and d\endadd\ to show how close they ought to be when they get put in by the hooks.
The sequence ought to be before..start..text..end..after.
\p
And that was a new parargaph. \add This is in an add\add* this isn't.
\v 2 Here in verse two  we look at hooks on paragraph breaks.
\m  That's a class m paragraph break. Let's make the line very very very much longer Lorum Ipsum  blah blah blah
\p And that was a p class paragraph break
\p As was that.
