\v 1 Paul, an apostle—not from men, nor through man, but through Jesus Christ,\f + \fr 1:1  \ft “Christ” means “Anointed One”.\f* and God the Father, who raised him from the dead— 
\v 2 and all the brothers\f + \fr 1:2  \ft The word for “brothers” here and where context allows may also be correctly translated “brothers and sisters” or “siblings.” \f* who are with me, to the assemblies of Galatia: 
\v 3 Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, 
\v 4 who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father— 
\v 5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen. 
\p
\righttext
\v 1 Paul the apostle, not of men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ,\f + \fr 1:1 \ft Christ a royal title for the announted king, promised by God.\f* and God the Father, that raised him from death \add [or that raised him from \sls (the)\sls* dead]\add*, 
\p
\v 2 and all the brethren that be with me, to the churches of Galatia, \sls (and all the brothers who be with me, to the churches in Galatia,)\sls* 
\p
\v 3 grace \sls (be)\sls* to you and \sls (the)\sls* peace of God the Father, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, 
\p
\v 4 that gave himself for our sins, to deliver us from the present wicked world, by the will of God and our Father, 
\p
\v 5 to whom is honour and glory into worlds of worlds. Amen. \sls (to whom be honour and glory forever and ever. Amen.)\sls* 
\p
\lefttext
\v 6 I marvel that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ to a different “good news”, 
\v 7 but there isn’t another “good news.” Only there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the Good News of Christ. 
\v 8 But even though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you any “good news” other than that which we preached to you, let him be cursed. 
\v 9 As we have said before, so I now say again: if any man preaches to you any “good news” other than that which you received, let him be cursed. 
\p
\righttext
\v 6 I wonder, that so soon ye be thus moved from him that called you into the grace of Christ, into another evangel \add [or into another gospel]\add*; \sls (I am amazed, that so quickly ye be moved away from him who called you into the grace of the Messiah, to another gospel;)\sls* 
\p
\v 7 which is not another, but that there be some that trouble you, and will mis-turn the evangel of Christ. \sls (which is not truly another gospel, but that there be some who trouble you, and will pervert the Gospel, or the Good News, of the Messiah.)\sls* 
\p
\v 8 But though we, or an angel of heaven, preached to you, besides that that we have preached to you, be he accursed. \add [But though we, or an angel of heaven, evangelized to you, besides that that we have evangelized to you, cursed be he.]\add* 
\p
\v 9 As I have said before, and now again I say, if any \em man\em* preach to you besides that that ye have received, be he accursed \add [or cursed be he]\add*. 
\p
\lefttext
\v 10 For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? Or am I striving to please men? For if I were still pleasing men, I wouldn’t be a servant of Christ. 
\p
\righttext
\v 10 For now whether counsel I men, or God? or whether I seek to please men? If I pleased yet men, I were not Christ’s servant, \sls (or If I still sought to please men, I would not be the Messiah’s servant)\sls*. 
\p
\lefttext
\v 11 But I make known to you, brothers, concerning the Good News which was preached by me, that it is not according to man. 
\v 12 For I didn’t receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came to me through revelation of Jesus Christ. 
\v 13 For you have heard of my way of living in time past in the Jews’ religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the assembly of God and ravaged it. 
\v 14 I advanced in the Jews’ religion beyond many of my own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers. 
\v 15 But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me from my mother’s womb and called me through his grace, 
\v 16 to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I didn’t immediately confer with flesh and blood, 
\v 17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia. Then I returned to Damascus. 
\p
\righttext
\v 11 For, brethren, I make known to you the evangel \add [or the gospel]\add*, that was preached of me \sls (or by me)\sls*, for it is not by man; 
\p
\v 12 nor I took it of man \sls (or nor I received it from any man)\sls*, nor learned \sls (it from any man)\sls*, but by \add [the]\add* revelation of Jesus Christ. 
\p
\v 13 For ye have heard my conversation sometime in the Jewry, that I pursued \sls (sur)\sls*passingly, \add [or over-manner, or \sls (over-)\sls* measure]\add*, the church of God, and fought against it. \sls (For ye have heard about my life before among the Jewry, how I persecuted God’s church beyond measure, and fought so very hard against it.)\sls* 
\p
\v 14 And I profited in the Jewry above many of mine even-elders in my kindred, and was more abundantly a follower \add [or a lover]\add* of my fathers’ traditions. 
\p
\v 15 But when it pleased him, that parted me \sls (or who separated me)\sls* from my mother’s womb, and called \sls (me)\sls* by his grace, 
\p
\v 16 to show his Son in me, that I should preach him among the heathen, anon I drew me not to flesh and blood; \sls (to show his Son to me, so that I would preach him among the Gentiles, at once I drew me not to flesh and blood;)\sls* 
\p
\v 17 nor I came to Jerusalem to the apostles, that were before me, but I went into Arabia, and again I turned again into Damascus. \sls (nor did I come to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went to Arabia, and then I returned to Damascus.)\sls* 
\p
\lefttext
\v 18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and stayed with him fifteen days. 
\v 19 But of the other apostles I saw no one except James, the Lord’s brother. 
\v 20 Now about the things which I write to you, behold,\f + \fr 1:20  \ft “Behold”, from “ἰδοὺ”, means look at, take notice, observe, see, or gaze at. It is often used as an interjection.\f* before God, I’m not lying. 
\v 21 Then I came to the regions of Syria and Cilicia. 
\v 22 I was still unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea which were in Christ, 
\v 23 but they only heard, “He who once persecuted us now preaches the faith that he once tried to destroy.” 
\v 24 So they glorified God in me. 
\p
\righttext
\v 18 And since three years after I came to Jerusalem \add [or Afterward after three years I came to Jerusalem]\add*, to see Peter, and I dwelled with him \sls (for)\sls* fifteen days; 
\p
\v 19 but I saw none other of the apostles, but James, \em our\em* Lord’s brother. 
\p
\v 20 And these things which I write to you, lo! before God I lie not. 
\p
\v 21 Afterward I came into the coasts of Syria and Cilicia. 
\p
\v 22 But I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea, that were in Christ \sls (or who were in the Messiah)\sls*; 
\p
\v 23 and they had only an hearing, that he that pursued us sometime \sls (ago)\sls*, preacheth now the faith, against which he fought sometime \sls (ago)\sls*; \sls (and they had only heard it said, that he who had persecuted us before, now preacheth the faith, which before he fought so very hard against;)\sls*

\p
\v 1 Then after a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. 
\v 2 I went up by revelation, and I laid before them the Good News which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately before those who were respected, for fear that I might be running, or had run, in vain. 
\v 3 But not even Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised. 
\v 4 This was because of the false brothers secretly brought in, who stole in to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage, 
\v 5 to whom we gave no place in the way of subjection, not for an hour, that the truth of the Good News might continue with you. 
\v 6 But from those who were reputed to be important—whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God doesn’t show partiality to man—they, I say, who were respected imparted nothing to me, 
\v 7 but to the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the Good News for the uncircumcised, even as Peter with the Good News for the circumcised— 
\v 8 for he who worked through Peter in the apostleship with the circumcised also worked through me with the Gentiles— 
\v 9 and when they perceived the grace that was given to me, James and Cephas and John, those who were reputed to be pillars, gave to Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision. 
\v 10 They only asked us to remember the poor—which very thing I was also zealous to do. 
\p
\righttext
\v 1 And since fourteen years after \add [or Afterward after fourteen years]\add*, again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took with me Titus. 
\p
\v 2 I went up by revelation, and spake with them the evangel \add [or the gospel]\add*, which I preach among the heathen, \sls (or I went up by revelation, and spoke, or shared, the Gospel, or the Good News, with them, which I preach among the Gentiles)\sls*; and by themselves to these that seemed to be somewhat, lest I run \add [or lest peradventure I should run]\add*, or had run in vain. 
\p
\v 3 And neither Titus, that had been with me, while he was heathen, was compelled to be circumcised; \sls (And Titus, who had been with me, while he was a Gentile, was not compelled to be circumcised;)\sls* 
\p
\v 4 but for false brethren that were brought in, which had \add [privily]\add* entered to espy our freedom \add [or our liberty]\add*, which we have in Jesus Christ, to bring us \add [or to drive us]\add* into servage \sls (or to drive us into servitude, or into slavery)\sls*. 
\p
\v 5 But we gave no place to subjection, that the truth of the gospel should dwell with you. \sls (But we did not submit to their domination, so that the truth of the Gospel or the Good News would remain with you.)\sls* 
\p
\v 6 But of these that seemed to be somewhat \sls (or to be esteemed)\sls*; which they were sometime, it pertaineth not to me, for God taketh not the person of \sls (a)\sls* man \sls (or for God favoureth not any person)\sls*; for they that seemed to be somewhat \sls (or to be esteemed)\sls*, gave me nothing. 
\p
\v 7 But on the contrary, when they had seen, that the evangel of \sls (the)\sls* prepuce \sls (or for the uncircumcision)\sls* was given to me \add [or that the gospel of heathen men is betaken to me]\add*, as the evangel of \sls (the)\sls* circumcision \em was given\em* to Peter; \sls (But on the contrary, when they had seen, that the Gospel, or the Good News, for the uncircumcised, or the heathen, or the Gentiles, was given to me, like the Gospel, or the Good News, for the circumcised, or the Jews, \em was given\em* to Peter;)\sls* 
\p
\v 8 for he that wrought to Peter in apostlehood of \sls (the)\sls* circumcision, wrought also to me among the heathen; \sls (for he who made Peter the apostle to the circumcised, also made me the apostle to the Gentiles;)\sls* 
\p
\v 9 and when they had known the grace \em of God\em*, that was given to me, James, and Peter \add [or Cephas]\add*, and John, which were seen to be the pillars, they gave the right hand of fellowship to me and to Barnabas, that we \add [preach]\add* among the heathen \sls (or that we \em preach\em* among the Gentiles)\sls*, and they into the circumcision; 
\p
\v 10 only that we had mind of, \add [or that we should be mindful of]\add*, \sls (the)\sls* poor men, the which thing I was full busy to do. \sls (only that we should remember the poor, which I already was always doing.)\sls* 
\p
\lefttext
\v 11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he stood condemned. 
\v 12 For before some people came from James, he ate with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision. 
\v 13 And the rest of the Jews joined him in his hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy. 
\v 14 But when I saw that they didn’t walk uprightly according to the truth of the Good News, I said to Peter before them all, “If you, being a Jew, live as the Gentiles do, and not as the Jews do, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as the Jews do? 
\p
\righttext
\v 11 But when Peter was come to Antioch, I against-stood him in the face, \sls (or I stood up against him, or I opposed him, to his face)\sls*, for he was worthy to be reproved. 
\p
\v 12 For before that there came some men from James \add [or Forsooth before that some came from James]\add*, he ate with heathen men; but when they were come, he withdrew, and departed him\sls (self)\sls*, dreading them that were of \sls (the)\sls* circumcision. \sls (For before that some men came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they had come, he withdrew, and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision.)\sls* 
\p
\v 13 And the other \em Jews\em* assented \add [or consented]\add* to his feigning, so that Barnabas was drawn of \sls (or by)\sls* them into that feigning. 
\p
\v 14 But when I saw, that they walked not rightly to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter \add [or to Cephas]\add* before all men, If thou, that art a Jew, livest heathen-like, and not Jew-like, how constrainest thou heathen men to become Jews? \sls (or how can thou compel Gentiles to become Jews?)\sls* 
\p
\lefttext
\v 15 “We, being Jews by nature and not Gentile sinners, 
\v 16 yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed in Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ and not by the works of the law, because no flesh will be justified by the works of the law. 
\v 17 But if while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a servant of sin? Certainly not! 
\v 18 For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a law-breaker. 
\v 19 For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God. 
\v 20 I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. That life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself up for me. 
\v 21 I don’t reject the grace of God. For if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nothing!” 
\p
\righttext
\v 15 We Jews of kind, and not sinful men of the heathen, \sls (We Jews by kind, or naturally, and not of the sinners of the Gentiles, as they be called,)\sls* 
\p
\v 16 know that a man is not justified of the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ; and we believe in Jesus Christ, that we be justified of \add [or by]\add* the faith of Christ, and not of the works of the law. Wherefore of the works of the law each flesh shall not be justified. \sls (know that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but by faith in Jesus Christ; and we believe in Jesus Christ, that we be justified by faith in the Messiah, and not by doing the works of the Law. And so by doing the works of the Law each flesh shall not be justified.)\sls* 
\p
\v 17 And if we seek to be justified in Christ, we ourselves be found sinful men \add [or to be sinners]\add*, whether Christ be \sls (a)\sls* minister of sin? God forbid. \sls (And if we seek to be justified in the Messiah, and we ourselves be found to be sinners, then is the Messiah a servant of sin? God forbid.)\sls* 
\p
\v 18 And if I build again things that I have destroyed, I make myself a trespasser. 
\p
\v 19 For by the law I am dead to the law, \add [For by the law I am dead to the law, that I live to God;]\add* 
\p
\v 20 and I am fixed to the cross, that I live to God with Christ. And now live not I, but Christ liveth in me, \sls (or and I am fixed to the cross, so that I live to God with the Messiah. But now I do not live, but the Messiah who liveth in me)\sls*. But that I live now in \sls (the)\sls* flesh, I live in the faith of God’s Son, that loved me, and gave himself for me. \add [with Christ I am fixed to the cross. Forsooth I live now, not I, but Christ liveth in me. Forsooth that I live now in \sls (the)\sls* flesh, I live in the faith of God’s son, the which loved me, and betook \sls (or delivered)\sls* himself for me.]\add* 
\p
\v 21 I cast not away the grace of God; for if rightwiseness be through \sls (the)\sls* law \add [or for if rightwiseness is by the law]\add*, then Christ died without cause. \sls (I do not throw away God’s grace; because if righteousness can be gained through the Law, then the Messiah died without any reason or for no purpose.)\sls*

\v 1 Foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you not to obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly portrayed among you as crucified? 
\v 2 I just want to learn this from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? 
\v 3 Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, are you now completed in the flesh? 
\v 4 Did you suffer so many things in vain, if it is indeed in vain? 
\v 5 He therefore who supplies the Spirit to you and does miracles among you, does he do it by the works of the law, or by hearing of faith? 
\v 6 Even so, Abraham “believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.”\x + \xo 3:6  \xt Genesis 15:6\x* 
\v 7 Know therefore that those who are of faith are children of Abraham. 
\v 8 The Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the Good News beforehand to Abraham, saying, “In you all the nations will be blessed.”\x + \xo 3:8  \xt Genesis 12:3; 18:18; 22:18\x* 
\v 9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham. 
\p
\righttext
\v 1 O! unwitty Galatians, before whose eyes Jesus Christ is exiled, \add [or O! ye witless men of Galatia, before whose eyes Jesus Christ is damned or condemned]\add*, and is crucified in you, who hath deceived you, that ye obey not to truth? \sls (O foolish Galatians! before whom Jesus was shown to be condemned, and crucified, who hath deceived you, so that ye do not obey the truth?)\sls* 
\p
\v 2 This only I desire to learn of you, whether ye have received the Spirit of the works of the law, or of hearing of belief? \sls (I only desire to learn this from you, did ye receive the Spirit by doing the works of the Law, or by hearing and believing?)\sls* 
\p
\v 3 So ye be fools, that when ye have begun in Spirit \sls (or because what ye have begun in the Spirit)\sls*, \add [now]\add* ye be ended in \sls (the)\sls* flesh. 
\p
\v 4 So great things \add [or So many things]\add* ye have suffered without cause, \sls (or without any reason, or for any purpose)\sls*, if it be without cause. 
\p
\v 5 He that giveth to you \add [the]\add* Spirit, and worketh virtues in you, whether of works of the law, or of hearing of belief? \add [Therefore he that giveth to you the spirit, and worketh virtues in you, whether of the works of the law, or of hearing of faith?]\add* \sls (Giveth he the Spirit to you, and worketh works of power among you, because of ye doing the works of the Law, or because of ye hearing and believing?)\sls* 
\p
\v 6 As it is written, Abraham believed to God, and it was reckoned to him to rightwiseness. 
\p
\v 7 And therefore know ye, that these that be of belief, be the sons of Abraham. \add [Therefore know ye, that they that be of faith, they be the sons of Abraham.]\add* 
\p
\v 8 And the scripture seeing afar, that God justifieth the heathen of belief, \add [or Forsooth the scripture purveying, for God justifieth of faith heathen men]\add*, told before\sls (hand)\sls* to Abraham, That in thee all the heathen \add [or all \sls (the)\sls* folks]\add* shall be blessed. \sls (And the Scripture seeing afar off, that God justifieth the Gentiles by faith, said ahead of time to Abraham, Through thee all the nations and all the peoples shall be blessed.)\sls* 
\p
\v 9 And therefore these that be of belief, \add [or Therefore they that be of faith]\add*, \sls (or And so they who be of the faith or who have faith)\sls*, shall be blessed with faithful Abraham. 
\p
\lefttext
\v 10 For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who doesn’t continue in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.”\x + \xo 3:10  \xt Deuteronomy 27:26\x* 
\v 11 Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, “The righteous will live by faith.”\x + \xo 3:11  \xt Habakkuk 2:4\x* 
\v 12 The law is not of faith, but, “The man who does them will live by them.”\x + \xo 3:12  \xt Leviticus 18:5\x* 
\p
\righttext
\v 10 For all that be of \sls (or rely on)\sls* the works of the law, be under \sls (a)\sls* curse; for it is written, Each man \em is\em* cursed, that abideth not \add [or that dwelleth not]\add* in all \sls (the)\sls* things that be written in the book of the law \sls (or in the Book of the Law)\sls*, to do those things. 
\p
\v 11 And that no man is justified in the law before God, it is open, for a rightful man liveth of belief. \add [Forsooth for no man is justified in the law with God, it is known, for a rightful man liveth by faith.]\add* 
\p
\v 12 But the law is not of belief \sls (or But the Law is not a matter of faith)\sls*, but he that doeth those things \em of the law\em*, shall live in them. 
\p
\lefttext
\v 13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us. For it is written, “Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,”\x + \xo 3:13  \xt Deuteronomy 21:23\x* 
\v 14 that the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith. 
\p
\righttext
\v 13 But Christ again-bought us \add [or delivered us]\add* from the curse of the law \sls (or But the Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the Law)\sls*, and was made accursed for us; for it is written, Each man \em is\em* cursed that hangeth in \sls (or on)\sls* the tree; 
\p
\v 14 that among the heathen the blessing of Abraham were made in Jesus Christ, that we receive the promise of \sls (the)\sls* Spirit through belief. \add [that the blessing of Abraham in heathen men should be made in Christ Jesus, that we take the promise of \sls (the)\sls* Spirit by faith.]\add* \sls (so that among the Gentiles the blessing of Abraham came through, or by, Jesus Christ, and so we receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.)\sls* 
\p
\lefttext
\v 15 Brothers, speaking of human terms, though it is only a man’s covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds to it. 
\v 16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his offspring.\f + \fr 3:16  \ft or, seed\f* He doesn’t say, “To descendants\f + \fr 3:16  \ft or, seeds\f*”, as of many, but as of one, “To your offspring”,\x + \xo 3:16  \xt Genesis 12:7; 13:15; 24:7\x* which is Christ. 
\v 17 Now I say this: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God in Christ, the law, which came four hundred thirty years after, does not annul, so as to make the promise of no effect. 
\v 18 For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise; but God has granted it to Abraham by promise. 
\p
\righttext
\v 15 Brethren, I say after man, no man despiseth the testament \sls (or the covenant)\sls* of a man that is confirmed, or ordaineth above, \sls (or can add, or subtract)\sls*, \sls (any)\sls* \add [other thing]\add*. 
\p
\v 16 The promises were said to Abraham and to his seed; he saith not, In \add [the]\add* seeds, as in many, but as in one, And to thy seed, that is, Christ \sls (or the Messiah)\sls*. 
\p
\v 17 But I say, this testament \em is\em* confirmed of God, \sls (or But I say, this covenant \em is\em* confirmed by God)\sls*; the law that was made after four hundred and thirty years, maketh not the testament \sls (in)\sls* vain to void away the promise \add [or maketh \sls (it)\sls* not void for to do away the promise]\add*. 
\p
\v 18 For if \add [the]\add* heritage \em were\em* of the law, \em it were\em* not now of \sls (the)\sls* promise, \sls (or For if the inheritance \em (is)\em* by the Law, \em (it is)\em* not by the Promise)\sls*. But God granted \add [or gave]\add* to Abraham through \sls (the)\sls* promise. 
\p
\lefttext
\v 19 Then why is there the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise has been made. It was ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator. 
\v 20 Now a mediator is not between one, but God is one. 
\p
\righttext
\v 19 What then the law? that is, Whereto is the law profitable? \add [or What therefore profiteth the law?]\add* It was set for trespassing, till the seed came, to whom he had made the promise. \em Which law\em* was ordained by angels, in the hand of a mediator. 
\p
\v 20 But a mediator is not of one. But God is one. 
\p
\lefttext
\v 21 Is the law then against the promises of God? Certainly not! For if there had been a law given which could make alive, most certainly righteousness would have been of the law. 
\v 22 But the Scripture imprisoned all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.

\v 1 But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he is no different from a bondservant, though he is lord of all, 
\v 2 but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed by the father. 
\v 3 So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental principles of the world. 
\v 4 But when the fullness of the time came, God sent out his Son, born to a woman, born under the law, 
\v 5 that he might redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as children. 
\v 6 And because you are children, God sent out the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, “Abba,\f + \fr 4:6  \ft Abba is a Greek spelling for the Aramaic word for “Father” or “Daddy” used in a familiar, respectful, and loving way. \f* Father!” 
\v 7 So you are no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. 
\p
\righttext
\v 1 But I say, as long \sls (a)\sls* time as the heir is a little child, he diverseth nothing from a servant, when he is \sls (the)\sls* lord of all things, \add [or when he is lord of all]\add*, \sls (or even though he is the lord of all)\sls*; 
\p
\v 2 but he is under keepers and tutors, into the time determined of the father \sls (or until the time determined by his father)\sls*. 
\p
\v 3 So we, when we were little children, we served under the elements of the world. 
\p
\v 4 But after that the fulfilling of time came, God sent his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, 
\p
\v 5 that he should again-buy them that were under the law, that we should receive the adoption of sons. \sls (so that he would redeem those who were under the Law, so that we could receive adoption as sons.)\sls* 
\p
\v 6 And for ye be God’s sons, God sent his Spirit into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father. \add [Forsooth for ye be the sons of God, God sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, that is, father.]\add*

\v 7 And so there is not now a servant, but a son; and if \em he is\em* a son, \em he is\em* an heir by God.

\v 8 However at that time, not knowing God, you were in bondage to those who by nature are not gods. 
\v 9 But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, why do you turn back again to the weak and miserable elemental principles, to which you desire to be in bondage all over again? 
\v 10 You observe days, months, seasons, and years. 
\v 11 I am afraid for you, that I might have wasted my labor for you.

\righttext
\v 8 But then ye unknowing God, served to them that in kind were not gods. \sls (But when ye did not know God, ye served those who by their very nature were not gods.)\sls*

\v 21 Tell me, you that desire to be under the law, don’t you listen to the law? 
\v 22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by the servant, and one by the free woman. 
\v 23 However, the son by the servant was born according to the flesh, but the son by the free woman was born through promise. 
\v 24 These things contain an allegory, for these are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children to bondage, which is Hagar. 
\v 25 For this Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to the Jerusalem that exists now, for she is in bondage with her children. 
\v 26 But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is the mother of us all. 
\v 27 For it is written, 
\q1 “Rejoice, you barren who don’t bear. 
\q2 Break out and shout, you who don’t travail. 
\q2 For the desolate women have more children than her who has a husband.” \x + \xo 4:27  \xt Isaiah 54:1\x* 
\p
\righttext
\v 21 Say to me, ye that will be under the law, have ye not read the law? 
\p
\v 22 For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one of a servant \add [or of a handmaiden]\add*, and one of a free woman \add [or of a wife]\add*. 
\p
\v 23 But he that \em was\em* of the servant \add [or of the handmaiden]\add* was born after the flesh; but he that \em was\em* of the free woman \add [or of the wife]\add* by a promise. 
\p
\v 24 The which things be said by another understanding. For these be two testaments \sls (or For they be two covenants)\sls*; one in the hill of Sinai, \sls (en)\sls*gendering into servage, \sls (or begetting into servitude, or into slavery)\sls*, which is Agar. \add [Which things be said by allegory.

\p
\v 25 For Sinai is an hill \em that is\em* in Arabia, which \em hill\em* is joined to it that is now Jerusalem, and serveth with her children. 
\p
\v 26 But that Jerusalem that is above, is free, which is our mother. 
\p
\v 27 For it is written, Be glad, thou barren, that bearest not; break out and cry, \add [thou]\add* that bringest forth no children; for many sons \em be\em* of her that is left of her husband, more than of her that hath an husband, \sls (or for there \em shall be\em* more sons of her who was deserted by her husband, than of her who hath a husband)\sls*.

\v 28 Now we, brothers, as Isaac was, are children of promise. 
\v 29 But as then, he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now. 
\v 30 However, what does the Scripture say? “Throw out the servant and her son, for the son of the servant will not inherit with the son of the free woman.”\x + \xo 4:30  \xt Genesis 21:10\x* 
\v 31 So then, brothers, we are not children of a servant, but of the free woman.

\p
\v 30 But what saith the scripture? Cast out the servant \add [or the handmaiden]\add* and her son, for the son of the servant shall not be heir with the son of the free \em wife\em*. 
\p
\v 31 And so, brethren, we be not sons of the servant \add [or of the handmaiden]\add*, but of the free \em wife\em*, by which freedom \add [or liberty]\add* Christ hath made us free. \sls (And so brothers, we be not the sons of the handmaid, but the sons of the free \em wife\em*, by which freedom the Messiah hath made us free.)\sls*

\v 15 For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision is anything \sls (of)\sls* worth, nor prepuce, but a new creature. \sls (For in Jesus Christ being circumcised is not worth anything, nor being uncircumcised, but only being a new creation.)\sls* 
\p
\v 16 And whoever \add [shall]\add* \sls (pur)\sls*sue this rule \sls (or And whoever shall follow this rule)\sls*, peace \sls (be)\sls* on them, and mercy, and on \sls (the)\sls* Israel of God.

\v 17 From now on, let no one cause me any trouble, for I bear the marks of the Lord Jesus branded on my body. 
\p
\righttext
\v 17 And hereafter \add [or From henceforth]\add*, no man be heavy to me; for I bear in my body the tokens, \add [or the wounds]\add*, of our Lord Jesus Christ \sls (or for I bear on my body the signs, or the marks, of our Lord Jesus Christ)\sls*.

\v 18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen. \p
