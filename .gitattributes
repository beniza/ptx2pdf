# Designed to tell git how to best deal with certain file formats
# The goal for eols is to have LF in the repo and platform-specific
# endings, when appropriate, in the working copy on all platforms.
# To tweak to your particular needs,
# see http://git-scm.com/book/en/Customizing-Git-Git-Attributes

# The following causes git to auto detect text files which will have eol
# conversion applied according to core.autocrlf and core.eol
* text=auto
