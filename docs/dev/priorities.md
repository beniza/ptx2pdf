## Priorities for new features

0. Not crashing on attributes [DONE? (dev)]
1. Single Milestone parsing as a style anchor [WIP (dev)]
2. Very basic attribute parsing as style anchor
4. \fe processed as end-not [WIP (master)]

## Other challenges (Non-priortised)
 * Multiple milestone style anchoring (not combined list)
 * enhance parlocs file so that column start and end are also recorded, then use it to apply background colour to paragraphs
 * parse stylesheet to set default attribute
 * refactor diglots to not assume so much about layout e.g. (\csname \insname takesSpaceFrom\endcsname=B/L/R)
 * 'Simple' top/bottom diglots
 * Background Pictures in side bars
 * Foreground pictures in side bars
 * Colour backgrounds for section headings
 * Fancy border maker.
