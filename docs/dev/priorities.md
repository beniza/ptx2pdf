## Priorities for new features

0. Not crashing on attributes [DONE]
1. Single Milestone parsing as a style anchor [WIP]
2. Very basic attribute parsing as style anchor
4. \fe processed as end-not [WIP]

## Other challenges (Non-priortised)
. Multiple milestone style anchoring (not combined list)
. parse stylesheet to set default attribute
. refactor diglots to not assume so much about layout e.g. (\csname \insname takesSpaceFrom\endcsname=B/L/R)
. 'Simple' top/bottom diglots
. Background Pictures in side bars
. Foreground pictures in side bars
. Colour backgrounds for section headings
. Fancy border maker.
