"Bible Layout For Everyone" - Easily create scripture PDFs for trial publications

PTXprint is an easy-to-use program which harnesses the power of extended macros from PTX2PDF which is a XeTeX based macro package for typesetting USFM formatted (Paratext) scripture files. 

PTXprint is available for both Linux and Windows from the main home page: https://software.sil.org/ptxprint/#downloads
It is 64-bit software and will NOT run on 32-bit versions of Windows. It is recommended to be used with Paratext 8 (or later), but can also work even if Paratext is NOT installed. It is not (yet) part of the Paratext ecosystem, so does not get automatically updated. Please check the home page regularly for updated versions.

There is a Scripture Software Community page dedicated to PTXprint (https://community.scripture.software.sil.org/c/ptxprint/27) where you can get assistance from other PTXprint users.

Please use "New Issue" button in the GitHub Issue Tracking System (https://github.com/sillsdev/ptx2pdf/issues) to report any bugs, or document suggestions for improvement. 

If you serve in a sensitive location, you may report issues directly by e-mail <ptxprint_support@sil.org> rather than via the publicly accessible websites listed above.
