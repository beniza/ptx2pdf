PTXprint 1.6.1 Release Notes 
13 April 2021

"Bible Layout For Everyone" - Easily create scripture PDFs for trial publications

Bug fixes and Improvements in 1.6.1

WARNING: For those using RTL scripts:
		 The TeX macros have been changed for RTL for Right and Left Justification 
         such that they are swapped. This means that you no longer have to swap the 
		 Right and Left Justifications on markers like \q. If justification is Left, 
		 it will be Right-justified. PTXprint *should* update your styles automatically.		 

  * Add "End-of-Ayah" option for verse decorator on the Tabs+Border tab 
  
  * Added option to move "End-of-Ayah" to end of verse

  * If "Include Pictures" is checked but no PicList is found, auto-initiate "Generate" dialog
  
  * Autoinsert beginL/R in zimagecopyrights
  
  * Make DBL bundle unzipping more intelligent so that it finds the metadata file even if buried
  
  * Update styles by version
  
  * Provide helpful feedback if user tries to print when fonts have not yet been set 
  
  * Add "How?" link to Pictures "Omit only app and web pics" option
  
  * Fix derived fonts on reset configurations
  
  * Fix interlinear for Intro matter (ch1:vs0)
  
  * Fixed Preferred image type handling to follow the list of extensions strictly
  
Bug fixes and Improvements in 1.6.0.4

  * Added Decorative Section Heading graphic for 2-col layouts
  
  * Fixed RTL defaults
  
  * Added autogenerated tooltips to Font Feature selection dialog

  * Allow longer Colophons to flow onto subsequent page
  
  * Turn off image copyrights for colophon if pictures are not enabled

Bug fixes and Improvements in 1.6.0.3

  * Fixed Adjust Lists for diglots (again!)

Bug fixes and Improvements in 1.6.0.2

  * Paragraphed endnotes are now working
  
  * The whole of the Arabic UI is RTL (when used with the appropriate locale settings)
  
  * PDF bookmark list improved
  
  * Fixed Adjust Lists in diglots (not!)
  
  * Don't swap left and right style alignment when choosing script direction (as the macros handle it)
  
  * Make sure all Footnote and Cross-Reference settings are remembered and do as advertised

  * Removed "Persian" digits from list of scripts - use "Arabic-Indic" instead
  
  * Added "Fullwidth" digits to list of scripts - mainly used with CJK scripts
  
  * Fixed picture media settings: (P)rint  (A)pp  (W)eb  now respect default values

  * Outstanding known issue: There is an occasional problem with (long?) footnotes getting doubled in diglots.
    This is probably triggered when a footnote is the reason for a heading to be moved onto the next page, so
	a good workaround is to use the AdjList to jiggle the text at that point until it resolves.

Improvements in 1.6

  * Diglot code has been re-written to be more robust and adaptable to structural differences between texts

  * Added "Quick Run" option with a Warning/Status message in red on the bottom status bar after a run
