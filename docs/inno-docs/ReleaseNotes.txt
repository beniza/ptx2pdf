PTXprint 0.5.0 Beta Release Notes
30th April 2020

List of improvements:

  * Saved Configurations are now possible, and these are shared via S/R with other Paratext users of the same project

  * All the Tabs can be Shown/Hidden as required - enabling a very simple view for users who don't need complexity

  * Handling of illustrations has been completely revamped and hopefully greatly improved with increased flexibility

  * Conversion of TIF images to the PDF image format happens automagically when required

  * Illustrations in USFM3 markup are now handled natively by XeTeX (but has only been minimally tested)

  * Top-to-Bottom (Left-to-Right) text flow direction is now supported (i.e. vertical text layout)

  * The Tooltip messages have been enhanced significantly

  * Font-based Glyph Metrics can now override the line spacing options (dynamic vertical line spacing for Arabic script)

  * A warning is issued if an improperly installed font is chosen from the Font chooser dialog

  * Graphite rendering has always been enabled by default (if the font supports it), but can now be disabled if needed

  * An extra/fallback font can be defined to handle (punctuation) characters that are not found in the Regular font

  * A button that helps you locate/list any characters that are missing from the Regular font has been added

  * Minor improvements in the Footnotes area - buttons to re-load the Callers from PT's settings, and the ':' addition:

  * Clicking the "Print" button makes it GREEN to let you know that it is working

  * When you Regenerate PicLists or AdjLists, it checks if you want to overwrite any existing files

  * There's an option to print the name of the Saved Configuration as footer of the first page of each book

  * There's an option to bridge empty verses adding {...} in place of the missing text

  * All dialog boxes and error messages now stay on top
  
  * Keyboard shortcuts for Print (Ctrl-P) and Save (Ctrl-S) have been added

  * A splash-screen pops up when PTXprint starts, letting you know that something's actually happening

  * An About dialog has been added, with an MIT license and credits

Bug fixes:

  * Setting the Script for Digits now works as advertised

  * Changes to PrintDraftChanges.txt were not being picked up until PTXprint was re-started

  * Specific rules specified in PrintDraftChanges.txt were being ignored

  * Footnotes disappeared off the end of the page under certain conditions

  * USFM filenames using a Prefix as well as a Suffix weren't being found

  * Font features were not being activated


Rough edges:

  * Decorative borders, section headings and verse numbers is still a work in progress

  * Fuzzy/DIY-diglot still works if you know how to configure it but it is still too difficult for most

  * Helping users understand how to use PicLists and ParaAdjustLists is another area that could do with some help

  * The file/log viewer is still very fragile and needs some attention

  * It would also be helpful to have a Linux package built for easy installation


Known shortcomings - don't report them again:

  * In Windows some fonts are being listed a "Oblique" instead of "Italic" so you would have to manually select them for each face

  * Some font names don't display properly in the Font Chooser dialog

  * There are still a couple of known XeTeX issues which occur under rare circumstances
