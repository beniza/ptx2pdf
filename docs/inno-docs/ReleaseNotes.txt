PTXprint 0.6.1 Beta Release Notes
14th May 2020

Bug fixes in: 0.6.1

  * Found the missing Application icon
  
  * Fixed the path to Secondary Merge PDF for Diglots

List of improvements: 0.6.0

  * Added new custom-built Font Chooser dialog so that only valid and usable
    font files will be listed (and no more ToFu font names, or problems with
    Oblique/Italic and Bold Oblique/BoldItalic fonts being ignore)
  
  * Added helpful diagnostic messages when creating PDF fails
  
  * Added default paths for folders, & other PDF assets (watermarks borders)
  
  * Added support for Chapter Labels in specific user-defined books (Psalms,
    Proverbs, etc.)
  
  * Re-arranged some UI elements to make it more intuitive and less crowded
  
  * By default, books are arranged into a logical order, but this can be
    overwritten by editing/re-arranging the list of books

  * Allow out of canonical sequence for books 
    (e.g. INT MAT ... REV PSA PRO BAK TDX NDX GLO)


List of improvements: 0.5.4

  * Enable headless (no GUI) running of PTXprint so that PDFs are produced 
    from the commandline (great for regression testing, and much more)


List of improvements: 0.5.3

  * Colour has been added - so that if \Color is defined in the .sty file(s)
    those colours can be applied in the text if the option is Enabled on the
    Advanced tab
  
  * Eliminate looping in the UI when changing projects and there are multiple
    Saved Configurations
  
  * Eliminate an endless loop when trying to balance a tight page (XeTeX)
  
  * Handle \Bold - in .sty and also for Italic, Underline, etc.
  
  * Fix Empty (ch:vs) refs in captions 


List of improvements: 0.5.1

  * Illustration Handling has been made more flexible and robust to handle
    special characters in image filenames
  
  * PicLists have the same options as inline \fig ... \fig* illustrations
    (hide caption, skip missing pics, etc.)
  
  * Fixed a few XeTeX bugs


List of improvements: 0.5.0

  * Saved Configurations are now possible, and these are shared via S/R
    with other Paratext users of the same project

  * All the Tabs can be Shown/Hidden as required - enabling a very simple
    view for users who don't need complexity

  * Handling of illustrations has been completely revamped and hopefully
    greatly improved with increased flexibility

  * Conversion of TIF images to the PDF image format happens automagically
    when required

  * Illustrations in USFM3 markup are now handled natively by XeTeX (but has
    only been minimally tested)

  * Top-to-Bottom (Left-to-Right) text flow direction is now supported
    (i.e. vertical text layout)

  * The Tooltip messages have been enhanced significantly

  * Font-based Glyph Metrics can now override the line spacing options
    (dynamic vertical line spacing for Arabic script)

  * A warning is issued if an improperly installed font is chosen from
    the Font chooser dialog

  * Graphite rendering has always been enabled by default (if the font
    supports it), but can now be disabled if needed

  * An extra/fallback font can be defined to handle (punctuation) characters
    that are not found in the Regular font

  * A button that helps you locate/list any characters that are missing from
    the Regular font has been added

  * Minor improvements in the Footnotes area - buttons to re-load the Callers
    from PT's settings, and the ':' addition:

  * Clicking the "Print" button makes it GREEN to show that it is working

  * When you Regenerate PicLists or AdjLists, it checks if you want to
    overwrite any existing files

  * There's an option to print the name of the Saved Configuration as footer
    of the first page of each book

  * There's an option to bridge empty verses adding {...} in place of the
    missing text

  * All dialog boxes and error messages now stay on top
  
  * Keyboard shortcuts for Print (Ctrl-P) and Save (Ctrl-S) have been added

  * A splash-screen pops up when PTXprint starts, letting you know that
    something's actually happening

  * An About dialog has been added, with an MIT license and credits


Bug fixes:

  * Setting the Script for Digits now works as advertised

  * Changes to PrintDraftChanges.txt were not being picked up until
    PTXprint was re-started

  * Specific rules specified in PrintDraftChanges.txt were being ignored

  * Footnotes disappeared off the end of the page under certain conditions

  * USFM filenames using a Prefix as well as a Suffix weren't being found

  * Font features were not being activated


Rough edges:

  * Decorative borders, section headings and verse numbers is still a work
    in progress

  * Fuzzy/DIY-diglot still works if you know how to configure it but it is
    still too difficult for most

  * Helping users understand how to use PicLists and ParaAdjustLists is
    another area that could do with some help

  * The file/log viewer is still very fragile and needs some attention

  * It would be helpful to have a Linux package built for easy installation


Known shortcomings - don't report them again:

  * There are still a few known XeTeX issues occuring under rare circumstances
