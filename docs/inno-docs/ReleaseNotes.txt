List of improvements: 0.5.0

  * Saved Configurations are now possible, and these are shared via S/R
    with other Paratext users of the same project

    view for users who don't need complexity

  * Handling of illustrations has been completely revamped and hopefully
    greatly improved with increased flexibility

  * Conversion of TIF images to the PDF image format happens automagically
    when required

  * Illustrations in USFM3 markup are now handled natively by XeTeX (but has
    only been minimally tested)

    (i.e. vertical text layout)

    (dynamic vertical line spacing for Arabic script)

    the Font chooser dialog

  * Graphite rendering has always been enabled by default (if the font
    supports it), but can now be disabled if needed

  * An extra/fallback font can be defined to handle (punctuation) characters
    that are not found in the Regular font

  * A button that helps you locate/list any characters that are missing from
    the Regular font has been added

    from PT's settings, and the ':' addition:

    overwrite any existing files

  * A splash-screen pops up when PTXprint starts, letting you know that
    something's actually happening

Bug fixes:

  * Setting the Script for Digits now works as advertised

  * Changes to PrintDraftChanges.txt were not being picked up until
    PTXprint was re-started

  * Specific rules specified in PrintDraftChanges.txt were being ignored

  * Footnotes disappeared off the end of the page under certain conditions

  * USFM filenames using a Prefix as well as a Suffix weren't being found

  * Font features were not being activated


Rough edges:

  * Decorative borders, section headings and verse numbers is still a work
    in progress

  * Fuzzy/DIY-diglot still works if you know how to configure it but it is
    still too difficult for most

  * Helping users understand how to use PicLists and ParaAdjustLists is
    another area that could do with some help

  * The file/log viewer is still very fragile and needs some attention

  * It would be helpful to have a Linux package built for easy installation


Known shortcomings - don't report them again:

  * There are still a few known XeTeX issues occuring under rare circumstances
